### Project Description
[ ReClaim is an innovative web application designed to help individuals locate their lost items on a college campus. By integrating QR codes, Google Forms, and a dynamic website, the platform provides an efficient way to report and claim lost items, promoting accountability and ease of use.]

### The Problem statement
[Losing personal items on a college campus is a common issue, and existing solutions like notice boards, verbal communication, or even asking through social media are inefficient and unreliable. Students and staff struggle to report, track, and claim lost items due to the lack of a centralized and accessible system. Additionally, there is no structured mechanism to validate claims, leading to confusion and delays in returning items. This project aims to address these challenges by developing a tech-enabled platform to streamline the lost-and-found process using web technologies and QR codes.]

### The Solution
[To address the inefficiencies in locating and claiming lost items on campus, this project proposes a centralized lost-and-found platform. QR codes will be strategically placed around the campus, enabling individuals who find or lose items to access the website easily. Those who find an item can scan the QR code to submit details about the item through a simple Google Form, while those searching for lost items can browse the posted entries on the platform. The platform will display item details, such as images, location found, and contact information, ensuring clarity and easy communication. This tech-enabled solution enhances accessibility, reliability, and speed in the lost-and-found process, eliminating dependency on notice boards or social media.]
